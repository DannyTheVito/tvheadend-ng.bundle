TV-Headend channel for Plex Media Server

This is a fork of the already existing bundle from moxz (https://github.com/moxz/tvheadend.bundle)

So, what has changed?

- Code rewrite to access the new api functions of the latest tvheadend builds.
- It's mandatory to enable the transcoding option within tvheadend. Otherwise you will not be
  able to stream to your web clients.
- Within the first step and releases there will not be any recording support.

TVheadend plugin Icon is a mockup of TVheadend logo (https://tvheadend.org) and Plex logo (http://plexapp.com) all rights to their respective owners. This Icon was created by moxz (https://github.com/moxz/tvheadend.bundle).
