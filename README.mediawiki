=== TV-Headend channel for Plex Media Server ===

This is a fork of the already existing bundle from [https://github.com/moxz/tvheadend.bundle moxz]

''So, what has changed?''

* Code rewrite to access the new api functions of the latest tvheadend builds.
* It's mandatory to enable the transcoding option within tvheadend. Otherwise you will not be able to stream to your web clients.
* Within the first step and releases there will not be any recording support.

''The TV-Headend channel icon is a mockup of the [https://tvheadend.org TV-Headend] and [http://plexapp.com Plex] logo. This Icon was created by [https://github.com/moxz/tvheadend.bundle moxz].''

=== Latest notes ===
* Use the preferences options '''Force remuxed streaming''' if you have problems with transcoding and multi resolutions. The disadvantage is that it cannot be guaranteed that the format/codec will be compatible with your device.
