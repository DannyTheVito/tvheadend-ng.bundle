''So, what has changed?''

* Code rewrite to access the new api functions of the latest tvheadend builds.
* It's mandatory to enable the transcoding option within tvheadend. Otherwise you will not be able to stream to your web clients.
* Within the first step and releases there will not be any recording support.
